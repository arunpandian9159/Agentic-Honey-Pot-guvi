The platform calls the participant's endpoint for every turn and waits up to 30 seconds per call.\n*   If a participant's endpoint responds in ~25 seconds per turn: **25s x 10 turns x 15 scenarios = ~62 minutes** of processing.\n*   If a participant's endpoint responds in ~2 seconds per turn: **2s x 10 turns x 15 scenarios = ~5 minutes** of processing.\n\n**Proof — fastest vs slowest teams:**\n\n&lt;img&gt;A bar chart comparing the processing time for the fastest and slowest teams. The y-axis represents time in minutes, ranging from 0 to 120. The x-axis lists team names: Team A, Team B, Team C, Team D, Team E, Team F, Team G, Team H, Team I, Team J, Team K, Team L, Team M, Team N, Team O, Team P, Team Q, Team R, Team S, Team T, Team U, Team V, Team W, Team X, Team Y, Team Z. The bars show that Team Z has the longest processing time (~120 minutes), while Team A has the shortest (~5 minutes). The difference between the fastest and slowest teams is significant.&lt;/img&gt;\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The platform's timeout setting of 30 seconds is designed to handle slow responses gracefully without crashing.\n*   The observed behavior is consistent across all teams, including the top-performing ones.\n*   The platform's design allows for scalability and can handle more complex scenarios in future evaluations.\n*   We appreciate your feedback and will continue to monitor and improve our platform based on your experiences.\n\n---\n\n\n## Page 2\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Team</th>\n      <th>Per-Turn Response Time</th>\n      <th>Total Evaluation Time</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Code Riders (fastest)</td>\n      <td>~27 seconds avg</td>\n      <td>6 minutes 57 seconds</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Scam Center (slowest)</td>\n      <td>~3 min 13 sec avg</td>\n      <td>49 minutes 40 seconds</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nCode Riders completed all 15 test cases in under 7 minutes. The platform was not stuck — it was waiting for slow endpoints.\n\n**Additional evidence from server logs:**\n\n*   **131 timeout errors** logged across 29 different participant hosts — their servers took longer than 30 seconds to respond\n*   Top offender: one participant's Render-hosted endpoint timed out **29 times**\n*   Participants using **ngrok** (10 errors), **VS Code Dev Tunnels** (6 timeouts), and local **laptops** experienced the worst delays because these are not production hosting solutions\n\n**From the documentation provided to participants:**\n\n\"Response time is under 30 seconds\" — listed as a requirement in the Requirements Checklist\n\n\"Common Failure Scenarios: API Timeout: Requests must complete within 30 seconds\"\n\nParticipants were explicitly warned about the 30-second timeout. The processing time was determined entirely by their endpoint speed.\n\n**Question 2:** \"Participants claimed that for the Honeypot problem, with the solution script there is no way of scoring 100%\"\n\n**Response:**\n\n100/100 is fully achievable. The scoring system was documented clearly with exact point breakdowns, and the self-test scripts provided to participants use the exact same evaluation logic.\n\n**Scoring breakdown (from the documentation given to participants):**\n\nEach category is independently achievable:\n\n---\n\n\n## Page 3\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Category</th>\n      <th>Max Points</th>\n      <th>How to Score</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Scam Detection</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>Set scamDetected: true</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Intelligence Extraction</td>\n      <td>40</td>\n      <td>Extract phones (10), bank accounts (10), UPI IDs (10), phishing links (10)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Engagement Quality</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>Duration &gt; 0s (5) + Duration &gt; 60s (5) + Messages &gt; 0 (5) + Messages &gt;= 5 (5)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Response Structure</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>status (5) + scamDetected (5) + extractedIntelligence (5) + engagementMetrics (2.5) + agentNotes (2.5)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Total</b></td>\n      <td><b>100</b></td>\n      <td></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n1. **Scam Detection (20 pts):** Just return \"scamDetected\": true. Every team that submitted a valid output got this. Trivial.\n2. **Intelligence Extraction (40 pts):** The scammer explicitly shares phone numbers, bank accounts, UPI IDs, and phishing links during the conversation. A basic regex or NLP parser extracts them. The data is literally handed to the honeypot in the conversation text.\n3. **Engagement Quality (20 pts):** Keep the conversation going for &gt;60 seconds with &gt;5 messages. Given that each scenario allows 10 turns, this is automatic for any functional honeypot. Teams that got 0 here failed to include engagementMetrics in their final output.\n4. **Response Structure (20 pts):** Return all required fields (status, scamDetected, extractedIntelligence) + optional fields (engagementMetrics, agentNotes). This is a formatting requirement.\n\n**The self-test scripts were provided:**\n\nThe documentation included complete Python and JavaScript self-test scripts with the `evaluate_final_output()` function — the exact same scoring logic used by the platform. Participants could run this locally before submitting to verify their score.\n\n**What participants actually missed:**\n\n---\n\n\n## Page 4\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Dimension</th>\n      <th>Available</th>\n      <th>Typical Score</th>\n      <th>Points Left</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Scam Detection</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Intelligence Extraction</td>\n      <td>40</td>\n      <td>23-35</td>\n      <td>5-17</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Engagement Quality</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Response Structure</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>12-15</td>\n      <td>5-8</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nThe biggest loss was **Engagement Quality (0/20)** — most teams didn’t include engagementMetrics in their final output, despite it being documented. And **Response Structure** lost points from missing optional fields (engagementMetrics, agentNotes).\n\n**The documentation provided multiple paths to a perfect score:**\n\nThe documentation gave participants everything needed to score 100/100 — through the scoring rubric tables, the JavaScript example, and the full source code of the scoring function. The Python example was one of several resources, not the only reference. Participants who relied solely on one example without reading the rubric or the scoring function missed what was clearly documented elsewhere.\n\n**Participants received detailed feedback through two channels:**\n\n1.  **Before submitting:** The self-test scripts (provided in the documentation) print a full per-category score breakdown locally, designed to help participants verify their output covers all scoring categories before submission.\n2.  **After evaluation:** The platform’s auto-review system provided a **detailed AI-generated comment** explaining exactly where points were lost. For example, one participant’s review (Score: 80) stated:\n\n    > \"The honeypot reliably flags scams (full 20-point detection) but falls short on intelligence extraction and red-flag identification, yielding modest scenario scores (~55/100) and limited engagement. Conversational handling is consistent in asking relevant questions yet lacks deeper probing and dynamic response structuring. Code quality is strong in repository organization and modular design, though documentation is incomplete, error handling is minimal, and stray compiled files remain. Improving intelligence extraction, red-flag spotting, and robust error handling/documentation will boost both detection performance and overall code robustness.\"\n\nThis comment tells the participant:\n*   **What they got right:** Full 20-point scam detection, consistent conversational handling, strong repo organization\n*   **What they missed:** Intelligence extraction, red-flag identification, limited engagement, lacks deeper probing\n\n---\n\n\n## Page 5\n\n*   **How to improve:** Improve intelligence extraction, red-flag spotting, error handling, documentation\n\n**1. The self-test was a PRE-SUBMISSION tool - and it prints the score breakdown:**\n\nThe documentation explicitly instructs participants to test before submitting:\n\n“Test your endpoint using the self-evaluation tool (provided below)” “You may have limited submission attempts, so verify everything first”\n\nRunning the self-test locally outputs a full per-category score breakdown:\n\n&lt;img&gt;Bar chart icon&lt;/img&gt; Your Score: 62/100\n- Scam Detection: 20/20\n- Intelligence Extraction: 30/40\n- Engagement Quality: 0/20 ← clearly shows this category needs attention\n- Response Structure: 12.5/20 ← clearly shows missing fields\n\nThe self-test was designed to show participants exactly which categories needed work. A developer who ran this would see two categories scoring near zero and know immediately what to fix — by reading the rubric or the scoring function source code, both of which were provided.\n\n**2. The evaluate_final_output() source code was given — it IS the answer key:**\n\nThe scoring function was provided in full, readable Python and JavaScript. Any developer can read 40 lines of code and see exactly what’s checked:\n\n```python\nmetrics = final_output.get('engagementMetrics', {})\nduration = metrics.get('engagementDurationSeconds', 0)\n```\n\nThis literally tells you: include engagementMetrics with engagementDurationSeconds. The answer to “how do I get 100?” is in the code they were given.\n\n**3. The JavaScript example DOES include all fields correctly:**\n\nThe documentation provides TWO self-test examples (Python and JavaScript). The JavaScript version includes status, engagementMetrics, and agentNotes. Between both examples, every scored field is demonstrated. Participants had complete coverage across the provided resources.\n\n**4. The scoring rubric table explicitly lists every field and its points:**\n\nRight above the self-test code, the documentation has clear tables listing engagementMetrics (2.5 pts) and all engagement quality criteria. These aren’t buried — they’re in formatted tables with point values. The rubric is the spec, the example is a starting point.\n\n**5. The documentation warns not to blindly follow examples:**\n\n---\n\n\n## Page 6\n\n“⚠️ Do not hardcode responses based on these example scenarios”\n“✅ Build a robust, generic scam detection system”\n\nThe documentation’s tone throughout is to think independently and not blindly copy.\n\nThe examples are illustrations, not submission templates.\n\n6. These are developers building AI-powered APIs — reading a scoring function is the minimum bar:\n\nParticipants are building honeypot systems with LLMs, NLP, and multi-turn conversation logic. Reading a 40-line scoring function to understand what fields are checked is a reasonable expectation at this skill level.\n\n**Verdict:** 100/100 is fully achievable. The scoring rubric tables, the JavaScript example, and the scoring function source code all clearly document every scored field and its point value. The self-test prints a full per-category breakdown specifically so participants can identify and address any missing fields before submitting. Every tool needed to score 100% was provided.\n\n**Question 3: “Some people got the response after refreshing the page some did not, there was no clarity on this”**\n\n**Response:**\n\nThis is expected behavior for a long-running evaluation process and is not a bug.\n\n**Why this happens:**\n\n*   When a participant submits, the platform begins running 15 scenarios sequentially (each with up to 10 turns).\n*   If the participant’s endpoint is slow (2-5 minutes per test case), the full evaluation can take **30-50 minutes**.\n*   During this time, the page shows “processing” because the evaluation is genuinely still running.\n*   **Refreshing the page** checks the current status. If the evaluation has completed by the time they refresh, they see the result. If not, it still shows processing.\n\n**This is not inconsistent behavior — it’s a timing issue:**\n\n*   Participant A refreshes after 45 minutes → evaluation done → sees result\n*   Participant B refreshes after 10 minutes → evaluation still running → still sees processing\n*   Participant B refreshes again after 50 minutes → now sees result\n\n**From the documentation provided:**\n\n---\n\n\n## Page 7\n\n\"Evaluation Timeline: Conversation Phase: Up to 10 turns (approximately 2-5 minutes)\"\n\nThis is per scenario. With 15 scenarios, total evaluation time ranges from ~7 minutes (fast endpoints) to ~50 minutes (slow endpoints).\n\n**Evidence that results were delivered for all completed evaluations:**\n\n*   All teams that had functioning endpoints received their scores\n*   The platform logged all 465 errors encountered — meaning it processed every request and recorded every outcome\n*   No “lost” evaluations — every submission was tracked with session IDs\n\n**Question 4: “No one passed all the test cases for the second problem statement”**\n\n**Response:**\n\nThis claim is factually incorrect. The evaluation data proves all test cases were passed and completed successfully. What participants didn’t achieve was a perfect score on each — because they missed optional fields in their response structure.\n\n**Evidence from the evaluation logs (evaluationDoc.json):**\n\nAll 15 test cases completed successfully:\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Value Across All 15 Test Cases</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>status</td>\n<td>\"evaluated\" for all 15</td>\n<td>Every test case ran to completion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>lastResponse.status</td>\n<td>\"success\" for all 15</td>\n<td>The participant's API responded correctly every time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>scamDetection</td>\n<td>20/20 for all 15</td>\n<td>Every scam was detected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>engagementQuality</td>\n<td>0/20 for all 15</td>\n<td>engagementMetrics was never included in the output</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>responseStructure</td>\n<td>12-15/20 for all 15</td>\n<td>Missing optional fields (engagementMetrics, agentNotes)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n---\n\n\n## Page 8\n\nAll 15 test cases were passed. Every scenario:\n\n*   Ran all 10 conversation turns\n*   Exchanged 19 messages\n*   Received a valid \"success\" response from the participant's API\n*   Detected the scam correctly (20/20)\n*   Extracted intelligence from the conversation\n\n\"Not passing\" vs \"not scoring 100%\" are completely different things:\n\n*   The test cases **passed** — the API responded, the scam was detected, intelligence was extracted, and a score was assigned.\n*   No one scored **100 per test case** because participants didn't include optional fields like `engagementMetrics` (costing 20 points) and in some cases missed `agentNotes` (costing 2.5 points).\n\nScore breakdown showing exactly where points were lost:\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scenario</th>\n<th>Score</th>\n<th>Scam Detection</th>\n<th>Intelligence</th>\n<th>Engagement</th>\n<th>Structure</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bank Fraud</td>\n<td>61</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>35/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UPI Fraud</td>\n<td>61</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>35/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Phishing Link</td>\n<td>63</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>35/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>KYC Fraud</td>\n<td>61</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>35/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Job Scam</td>\n<td>58</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>35/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>12/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lottery Scam</td>\n<td>46</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>11.67/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Electricity Bill</td>\n<td>52</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>23.33/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Govt Scheme</td>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>35/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crypto Investment</td>\n<td>61</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>35/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Customs Parcel</td>\n<td>54</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>23.33/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tech Support</td>\n<td>56</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>23.33/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Loan Approval</td>\n<td>61</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>35/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>12/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Income Tax</td>\n<td>55</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>23.33/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refund Scam</td>\n<td>48</td>\n<td>20/20</td>\n<td>17.5/40</td>\n<td>0/20</td>\n<td>15/20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n---\n\n\n## Page 9\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Insurance</td>\n    <td>52</td>\n    <td>20/20</td>\n    <td>23.33/40</td>\n    <td>0/20</td>\n    <td>15/20</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n**The pattern is clear:** Engagement Quality is **0/20 across every single test case** because participants overlooked **engagementMetrics** field in their final output. This alone accounts for 20 points lost per scenario. Response Structure lost 5-8 points per scenario for missing optional fields.\n\n**Evaluation consistency verified — scores computed twice, identical both times:**\n\nThe evaluation logs contain two independent records for each scenario — a summary-level score and a detailed test-case-level score. All 15 scenarios produce identical scores in both records, confirming the evaluation engine is deterministic and consistent:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Scenario</th>\n      <th>Summary Score</th>\n      <th>Test Case Score</th>\n      <th>Match?</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Bank Fraud</td>\n      <td>61</td>\n      <td>61</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>UPI Fraud</td>\n      <td>61</td>\n      <td>61</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Phishing Link</td>\n      <td>63</td>\n      <td>63</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>KYC Fraud</td>\n      <td>61</td>\n      <td>61</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Job Scam</td>\n      <td>58</td>\n      <td>58</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Lottery Scam</td>\n      <td>46</td>\n      <td>46</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Electricity Bill</td>\n      <td>52</td>\n      <td>52</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Govt Scheme</td>\n      <td>60</td>\n      <td>60</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Crypto Investment</td>\n      <td>61</td>\n      <td>61</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Customs Parcel</td>\n      <td>54</td>\n      <td>54</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Tech Support</td>\n      <td>56</td>\n      <td>56</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Loan Approval</td>\n      <td>61</td>\n      <td>61</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Income Tax</td>\n      <td>55</td>\n      <td>55</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Refund Scam</td>\n      <td>48</td>\n      <td>48</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Insurance</td>\n      <td>52</td>\n      <td>52</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n---\n\n\n## Page 10\n\nQuestion 5: “For Honeypot we said the participants also needs to classify the type of scam, however in the submission format there was no such field”\n\nResponse:\n\nScam type classification was never part of the scoring rubric. It was never a scored field, and its absence has zero impact on any participant’s score.\n\nThe documented Final Output format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sessionId\": \"abc123-session-id\",\n  \"scamDetected\": true,\n  \"totalMessagesExchanged\": 18,\n  \"extractedIntelligence\": {\n    \"phoneNumbers\": [],\n    \"bankAccounts\": [],\n    \"upiIds\": [],\n    \"phishingLinks\": [],\n    \"emailAddresses\": []\n  },\n  \"agentNotes\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nNo `scamType` field is required in participant output, and no points are awarded for it.\n\nThe scoring rubric (documented and shared with participants) scores exactly 4 things:\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scored Category</th>\n<th>Points</th>\n<th>Includes Scam Type?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Scam Detection (boolean)</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>No — only `scamDetected`: true/false</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intelligence Extraction</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>No — phones, accounts, UPIs, links</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Engagement Quality</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>No — duration and message count</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response Structure</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>No — field presence check</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nDirect evidence from the evaluation logs (evaluationDoc.json):\n\nThe `scamType` field exists in the evaluation data — but it is a **platform-internal scenario label**, not a participant-submitted field. It is used by the platform to identify which scenario is being run:\n\n---\n\n\n## Page 11\n\n// This is the PLATFORM's test case definition - NOT participant output\n{\n  \"scenarioId\": \"bank_fraud\",\n  \"scenarioName\": \"Bank Fraud Detection\",\n  \"scamType\": \"bank_fraud\", <- platform's internal label\n  \"conversationHistory\": [ ... ]\n}\n\nMeanwhile, the participant's finalOutput across all 15 test cases contains:\n\n// This is what the PARTICIPANT's API returned\n{\n  \"scamDetected\": true,\n  \"totalMessagesExchanged\": 19,\n  \"extractedIntelligence\": { ... },\n  \"agentNotes\": \"... \"\n}\n\nNo scamType field appears in any participant's output — because it was never required.\nAnd the scoring breakdown for every test case evaluates only:\n\n\"breakdown\": {\n  \"scamDetection\": 20, <- boolean check, not type classification\n  \"intelligenceExtraction\": 35,\n  \"conversationQuality\": { ... },\n  \"engagementQuality\": 0,\n  \"responseStructure\": 15\n}\n\nscamType is never referenced in any scoring calculation.

That experience matters, and we are committed to improving clarity in future editions.",
