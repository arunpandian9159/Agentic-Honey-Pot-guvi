# Responses to Participants’ Queries

**Date:** 2026-02-
**Context:** Point-by-point response to queries raised, backed by server logs, evaluation data,
and the official documentation provided to participants.

## Question 1: “After submitting, the screen was stuck at processing for majority of

## the participants”

**Response:**
The screen showed “processing” because the platform was **waiting for the participant’s
own endpoint to respond** - not because of any server-side issue.
**Evidence:
Metric Value**
Platform overhead between
test cases **50–120ms (consistent for ALL teams)**
Total test cases per
submission **15 scenarios x 10 turns each = 150 API calls**
Platform timeout per request **30 seconds
Why it appeared “stuck”:**

- Each submission triggers 15 scenarios with up to 10 conversation turns each. The
    platform calls the participant’s endpoint for every turn and waits up to 30 seconds
    per call.
- If a participant’s endpoint responds in ~25 seconds per turn: 25s x 10 turns x 15
    scenarios = ~62 minutes of processing.
- If a participant’s endpoint responds in ~2 seconds per turn: 2s x 10 turns x 15
    scenarios = ~5 minutes of processing.
**Proof — fastest vs slowest teams:**


**Team
Per-Turn Response
Time Total Evaluation Time**
Code Riders (fastest) ~27 seconds avg **6 minutes 57 seconds**
Scam Center
(slowest) ~3 min 13 sec avg **49 minutes 40 seconds**
Code Riders completed all 15 test cases in under 7 minutes. The platform was not stuck —
it was waiting for slow endpoints.
**Additional evidence from server logs:**

- **131 timeout errors** logged across 29 different participant hosts — their servers
    took longer than 30 seconds to respond
- Top offender: one participant’s Render-hosted endpoint timed out **29 times**
- Participants using **ngrok** (10 errors), **VS Code Dev Tunnels** (6 timeouts), and **local**
    **laptops** experienced the worst delays because these are not production hosting
    solutions
**From the documentation provided to participants:**
“Response time is under 30 seconds” — listed as a requirement in the
Requirements Checklist
“Common Failure Scenarios: API Timeout: Requests must complete within 30
seconds”
Participants were explicitly warned about the 30-second timeout. The processing time was
determined entirely by their endpoint speed.

## Question 2: “Participants claimed that for the Honeypot problem, with the

## solution script there is no way of scoring 100%”

**Response:
100/100 is fully achievable.** The scoring system was documented clearly with exact point
breakdowns, and the self-test scripts provided to participants use the exact same
evaluation logic.
**Scoring breakdown (from the documentation given to participants):
Each category is independently achievable:**


```
Category Max Points How to Score
Scam Detection 20 Set scamDetected: true
Intelligence
Extraction 40
Extract phones (10), bank accounts (10),
UPI IDs (10), phishing links (10)
Engagement Quality 20
Duration > 0s (5) + Duration > 60s (5) +
Messages > 0 (5) + Messages >= 5 (5)
Response Structure 20
status (5) + scamDetected (5) +
extractedIntelligence (5) +
engagementMetrics (2.5) + agentNotes
(2.5)
Total 100
```
1. **Scam Detection (20 pts):** Just return "scamDetected": true. Every team that
    submitted a valid output got this. Trivial.
2. **Intelligence Extraction (40 pts):** The scammer explicitly shares phone numbers,
    bank accounts, UPI IDs, and phishing links during the conversation. A basic regex or
    NLP parser extracts them. The data is literally handed to the honeypot in the
    conversation text.
3. **Engagement Quality (20 pts):** Keep the conversation going for >60 seconds with
    >5 messages. Given that each scenario allows 10 turns, this is automatic for any
    functional honeypot. Teams that got 0 here failed to include engagementMetrics in
    their final output.
4. **Response Structure (20 pts):** Return all required fields (status, scamDetected,
    extractedIntelligence) + optional fields (engagementMetrics, agentNotes). This
    is a formatting requirement.
**The self-test scripts were provided:**
The documentation included complete Python and JavaScript self-test scripts with the
evaluate_final_output() function — the **exact same scoring logic** used by the platform.
Participants could run this locally before submitting to verify their score.
**What participants actually missed:**


**Dimension Available Typical Score Points Left**
Scam Detection 20 20 0
Intelligence
Extraction 40 23–35 5–
Engagement Quality 20 0 **20**
Response Structure 20 12–15 5–
The biggest loss was **Engagement Quality (0/20)** — most teams didn’t include
engagementMetrics in their final output, despite it being documented. And **Response
Structure** lost points from missing optional fields (engagementMetrics, agentNotes).
**The documentation provided multiple paths to a perfect score:**
The documentation gave participants everything needed to score 100/100 — through the
scoring rubric tables, the JavaScript example, and the full source code of the scoring
function. The Python example was one of several resources, not the only reference.
Participants who relied solely on one example without reading the rubric or the scoring
function missed what was clearly documented elsewhere.
**Participants received detailed feedback through two channels:**

1. **Before submitting:** The self-test scripts (provided in the documentation) print a
    full per-category score breakdown locally, designed to help participants verify their
    output covers all scoring categories before submission.
2. **After evaluation:** The platform’s auto-review system provided a **detailed**
    **AI-generated comment** explaining exactly where points were lost. For example,
    one participant’s review (Score: 80) stated:
_“The honeypot reliably flags scams (full 20-point detection) but falls short on
intelligence extraction and red-flag identification, yielding modest scenario scores
(~55/100) and limited engagement. Conversational handling is consistent in asking
relevant questions yet lacks deeper probing and dynamic response structuring. Code
quality is strong in repository organization and modular design, though
documentation is incomplete, error handling is minimal, and stray compiled files
remain. Improving intelligence extraction, red-flag spotting, and robust error
handling/documentation will boost both detection performance and overall code
robustness.”_
This comment tells the participant:
- **What they got right:** Full 20-point scam detection, consistent conversational
handling, strong repo organization
- **What they missed:** Intelligence extraction, red-flag identification, limited
engagement, lacks deeper probing


- **How to improve:** Improve intelligence extraction, red-flag spotting, error handling,
    documentation
**1. The self-test was a PRE-SUBMISSION tool - and it prints the score breakdown:**
The documentation explicitly instructs participants to test before submitting:
_“Test your endpoint using the self-evaluation tool (provided below)” “You may have
limited submission attempts, so verify everything first”_
Running the self-test locally outputs a **full per-category score breakdown** :
📊 Your Score: 62/
- Scam Detection: 20/
- Intelligence Extraction: 30/
- Engagement Quality: 0/20 ← clearly shows this category needs
attention
- Response Structure: 12.5/20 ← clearly shows missing fields
The self-test was designed to show participants exactly which categories needed work. A
developer who ran this would see two categories scoring near zero and know immediately
what to fix — by reading the rubric or the scoring function source code, both of which were
provided.
**2. The evaluate_final_output() source code was given — it IS the answer key:**
The scoring function was provided in full, readable Python and JavaScript. Any developer
can read 40 lines of code and see exactly what’s checked:
metrics = final_output.get('engagementMetrics', {})
duration = metrics.get('engagementDurationSeconds', 0 )
This literally tells you: include engagementMetrics with engagementDurationSeconds. The
answer to “how do I get 100?” is in the code they were given.
**3. The JavaScript example DOES include all fields correctly:**
The documentation provides TWO self-test examples (Python and JavaScript). The
JavaScript version includes status, engagementMetrics, and agentNotes. Between both
examples, every scored field is demonstrated. Participants had complete coverage across
the provided resources.
**4. The scoring rubric table explicitly lists every field and its points:**
Right above the self-test code, the documentation has clear tables listing
engagementMetrics (2.5 pts) and all engagement quality criteria. These aren’t buried —
they’re in formatted tables with point values. The rubric is the spec, the example is a
starting point.
**5. The documentation warns not to blindly follow examples:**


_“_ ⚠ _Do not hardcode responses based on these example scenarios”
“_ ✅ _Build a robust, generic scam detection system”_
The documentation’s tone throughout is to think independently and not blindly copy.
The examples are illustrations, not submission templates.

**6. These are developers building AI-powered APIs — reading a scoring function is the
minimum bar:**
Participants are building honeypot systems with LLMs, NLP, and multi-turn conversation
logic. Reading a 40-line scoring function to understand what fields are checked is a
reasonable expectation at this skill level.
**Verdict:** 100/100 is fully achievable. The scoring rubric tables, the JavaScript example, and
the scoring function source code all clearly document every scored field and its point value.
The self-test prints a full per-category breakdown specifically so participants can identify
and address any missing fields before submitting. Every tool needed to score 100% was
provided.

## Question 3: “Some people got the response after refreshing the page some did

## not, there was no clarity on this”

**Response:**
This is expected behavior for a long-running evaluation process and is not a bug.
**Why this happens:**

- When a participant submits, the platform begins running 15 scenarios sequentially
    (each with up to 10 turns).
- If the participant’s endpoint is slow (2–5 minutes per test case), the full evaluation
    can take **30–50 minutes**.
- During this time, the page shows “processing” because the evaluation is genuinely
    still running.
- **Refreshing the page** checks the current status. If the evaluation has completed by
    the time they refresh, they see the result. If not, it still shows processing.
**This is not inconsistent behavior — it’s a timing issue:**
- Participant A refreshes after 45 minutes → evaluation done → sees result
- Participant B refreshes after 10 minutes → evaluation still running → still sees
processing
- Participant B refreshes again after 50 minutes → now sees result
**From the documentation provided:**


_“Evaluation Timeline: Conversation Phase: Up to 10 turns (approximately 2-
minutes)”_
This is per scenario. With 15 scenarios, total evaluation time ranges from ~7 minutes (fast
endpoints) to ~50 minutes (slow endpoints).
**Evidence that results were delivered for all completed evaluations:**

- All teams that had functioning endpoints received their scores
- The platform logged all 465 errors encountered — meaning it processed every
    request and recorded every outcome
- No “lost” evaluations — every submission was tracked with session IDs

## Question 4: “No one passed all the test cases for the second problem

## statement”

**Response:
This claim is factually incorrect.** The evaluation data proves all test cases were passed
and completed successfully. What participants didn’t achieve was a perfect score on each —
because they missed optional fields in their response structure.
**Evidence from the evaluation logs (evaluationDoc.json):**
All 15 test cases completed successfully:
**Field
Value Across
All 15 Test
Cases Meaning**
status
**“evaluated” for
all 15** Every test case ran to completion
lastResponse.status
**“success” for
all 15**
The participant’s API responded correctly every
time
scamDetection
**20/20 for all
15** Every scam was detected
engagementQuality **0/20 for all 15**
engagementMetrics was never included in
the output
responseStructure
**12–15/20 for
all 15**
Missing optional fields (engagementMetrics,
agentNotes)


**All 15 test cases were passed.** Every scenario:

- Ran all 10 conversation turns
- Exchanged 19 messages
- Received a valid "success" response from the participant’s API
- Detected the scam correctly (20/20)
- Extracted intelligence from the conversation
**“Not passing” vs “not scoring 100%” are completely different things:**
- The test cases **passed** — the API responded, the scam was detected, intelligence was
extracted, and a score was assigned.
- No one scored **100 per test case** because participants didn’t include optional fields
like engagementMetrics (costing 20 points) and in some cases missed agentNotes
(costing 2.5 points).
**Score breakdown showing exactly where points were lost:
Scenario Score Scam Detection Intelligence Engagement Structure**
Bank Fraud 61 20/20 35/40 **0/20** 15/
UPI Fraud 61 20/20 35/40 **0/20** 15/
Phishing Link 63 20/20 35/40 **0/20** 15/
KYC Fraud 61 20/20 35/40 **0/20** 15/
Job Scam 58 20/20 35/40 **0/20** 12/
Lottery Scam 46 20/20 11.67/40 **0/20** 15/
Electricity Bill 52 20/20 23.33/40 **0/20** 15/
Govt Scheme 60 20/20 35/40 **0/20** 15/
Crypto
Investment 61 20/20 35/40 **0/20** 15/
Customs Parcel 54 20/20 23.33/40 **0/20** 15/
Tech Support 56 20/20 23.33/40 **0/20** 15/
Loan Approval 61 20/20 35/40 **0/20** 12/
Income Tax 55 20/20 23.33/40 **0/20** 15/
Refund Scam 48 20/20 17.5/40 **0/20** 15/


Insurance 52 20/20 23.33/40 **0/20** 15/
**The pattern is clear:** Engagement Quality is **0/20 across every single test case** because
participants overlooked engagementMetrics field in their final output. This alone accounts
for 20 points lost per scenario. Response Structure lost 5–8 points per scenario for missing
optional fields.
**Evaluation consistency verified — scores computed twice, identical both times:**
The evaluation logs contain two independent records for each scenario — a summary-level
score and a detailed test-case-level score. All 15 scenarios produce identical scores in both
records, confirming the evaluation engine is deterministic and consistent:
**Scenario Summary Score Test Case Score Match?**
Bank Fraud 61 61 Yes
UPI Fraud 61 61 Yes
Phishing Link 63 63 Yes
KYC Fraud 61 61 Yes
Job Scam 58 58 Yes
Lottery Scam 46 46 Yes
Electricity Bill 52 52 Yes
Govt Scheme 60 60 Yes
Crypto Investment 61 61 Yes
Customs Parcel 54 54 Yes
Tech Support 56 56 Yes
Loan Approval 61 61 Yes
Income Tax 55 55 Yes
Refund Scam 48 48 Yes
Insurance 52 52 Yes


## Question 5: “For Honeypot we said the participants also needs to classify the

## type of scam, however in the submission format there was no such field”

**Response:
Scam type classification was never part of the scoring rubric.** It was never a scored
field, and its absence has zero impact on any participant’s score.
**The documented Final Output format is:**
{
"sessionId": "abc123-session-id",
"scamDetected": **true** ,
"totalMessagesExchanged": 18 ,
"extractedIntelligence": {
"phoneNumbers": [],
"bankAccounts": [],
"upiIds": [],
"phishingLinks": [],
"emailAddresses": []
},
"agentNotes": "..."
}
**No scamType field is required in participant output, and no points are awarded for it.
The scoring rubric (documented and shared with participants) scores exactly 4
things:
Scored Category Points Includes Scam Type?**
Scam Detection (boolean) 20
No — only scamDetected:
true/false
Intelligence Extraction 40 No — phones, accounts, UPIs, links
Engagement Quality 20 No — duration and message count
Response Structure 20 No — field presence check
**Direct evidence from the evaluation logs (evaluationDoc.json):**
The scamType field exists in the evaluation data — but it is a **platform-internal scenario
label** , not a participant-submitted field. It is used by the platform to identify which scenario
is being run:


**// This is the PLATFORM's test case definition — NOT participant output**
{
"scenarioId": "bank_fraud",
"scenarioName": "Bank Fraud Detection",
"scamType": "bank_fraud", **← platform's internal label**
"conversationHistory": [ **...** ]
}
Meanwhile, the **participant’s finalOutput** across all 15 test cases contains:
**// This is what the PARTICIPANT's API returned**
{
"scamDetected": **true** ,
"totalMessagesExchanged": 19 ,
"extractedIntelligence": { **...** },
"agentNotes": "..."
}
No scamType field appears in any participant’s output — because it was never required.
And the **scoring breakdown** for every test case evaluates only:
**"breakdown":** {
"scamDetection": 20 , **← boolean check** , **not type classification**
"intelligenceExtraction": 35 ,
"conversationQuality": { **...** },
"engagementQuality": 0 ,
"responseStructure": 15
}
scamType is **never referenced in any scoring calculation**. It exists purely as a scenario
identifier on the platform side.
**Verified across all 15 test case logs:
Check Result**
scamType in platform scenario
metadata?
Yes — as an internal label (e.g., "bank_fraud",
"upi_fraud")
scamType in participant
finalOutput? **No — not present in any of the 15 outputs**
scamType in scoring breakdown?
**No — never referenced in any scoring
dimension**
Points awarded/deducted for scam
classification? **0 — not a scored metric**


**If scam type classification was mentioned verbally during the event:**

- It was not part of the written scoring criteria
- It was not in the submission format
- It was not evaluated by the automated system
- No participant lost points for not including it
- Participants could optionally include it in agentNotes for context, but it carries no
    score impact
**The documentation states:**
_“Build a robust, generic scam detection system that can handle various fraud types”_

## Conclusion:

● All Honeypot submissions were evaluated across all defined scenarios
● Scoring was automated and identity-blind
● No submission was skipped or partially processed
● Scenario-level and summary-level scores matched consistently
● Extended “processing” time was linked to endpoint response duration; however,
clearer real-time progress visibility would have improved the overall experience
While the evaluation system operated as designed, we understand that the process did not
feel fully transparent to some participants. That experience matters, and we are committed
to improving clarity in future editions.
